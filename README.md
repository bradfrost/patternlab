Pattern Lab
==
Pattern Lab is a collection of tools to help create and maintain atomic web design systems.

## Atomic Design
All matter, no matter how complex, can be broken down into molecules which can be broken down further into atomic elements. All web interfaces can be broken down down the same way.  Atomic Design provides a methodology for building an effective design system. It consists of five distinct stages: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages.
